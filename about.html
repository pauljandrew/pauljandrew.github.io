          Hello! I've been developing software professionally for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
          I'm passionate about creating software that solves important problems, provides an amazing user experience, or (preferably) does both.
      </p>
          I've worked in various different countries, both onsite and remotely, for companies large and small.
      </p>
      <p>Most of my recent work has been in HLS/DASH video streaming apps for Smart TV devices, using Javascript and React.
