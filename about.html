      <p>
          Hi! I've been developing software professionally for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
          I'm passionate about creating software that solves important problems, provides an amazing user experience, or (preferably) does both.
      </p>
          I've worked in the UK, in NYC and in Mexico City, for companies large and small. I've done time as a manager, a QA engineer, a tech lead, a backend developer and a frontend developer.
      </p>
      <p>Most of my recent work has been on the frontend React, AngularJS and Ionic. I'm very comfortable with Javascript and Python on the server-side.
